## The Evolution of Point Clouds

Laser scanning has long been the gold standard for capturing existing conditions. However, the bottleneck has always been the "Scan-to-BIM" process—manually tracing millions of points into intelligent geometry. Today, we stand on the precipice of a new era where automated feature extraction is reshaping our workflows.

### Why AI Matters in Drafting

By leveraging computer vision algorithms, we can now classify structural elements from raw point cloud data with unprecedented accuracy. This isn't just about speed; it's about eliminating human error in complex MEP coordination.

> "The shift from manual tracing to algorithmic interpretation allows architects to focus on design intent rather than geometric reconstruction."

## Level of Development (LOD) Implications

When we talk about automation, we must consider LOD. While AI excels at LOD 200 (generic geometry), achieving LOD 400 (fabrication-ready detail) still requires human oversight.

### Key Benefits
*   **Speed**: Reduce modeling time by up to 50%.
*   **Accuracy**: Minimize deviation between as-built and digital twin.
*   **Cost**: Lower labor costs associated with manual drafting.

## Conclusion

As we integrate these tools into our pipeline at TDC, we are seeing a tangible shift in project delivery timelines. The future isn't just scanned; it's intelligent.
