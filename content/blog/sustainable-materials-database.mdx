## What is a Material Passport?

A Material Passport is a digital document set that records the characteristics of materials within a building. It provides value for recovery and reuse, essential for a circular economy.

### The Role of Data

At TDC, we are integrating material data directly into our BIM families. This allows for automated calculation of embodied carbon and potential resale value at the end of the building's lifecycle.

*   **Identity**: What is it? (Manufacturer, SKU)
*   **Composition**: What is it made of? (Chemical content, Recycled %)
*   **Performance**: How does it perform? (R-value, Acoustic rating)

## Implementing in Revit

We use shared parameters to track this data.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Sustainability_Carbon` | Number | Embodied Carbon (kgCO2e) |
| `Sustainability_Recyclability` | Text | Class A/B/C |
| `Lifecycle_End` | Date | Estimated replacement date |

## The Future of Circular Construction

As regulations tighten around carbon emissions, the material passport will become as standard as the blueprint itself.
