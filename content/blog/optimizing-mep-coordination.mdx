## The Retrofit Challenge

Retrofitting historic high-rises presents a unique set of challenges for MEP engineers. Unlike new construction, where shafts and plenums are designed around systems, retrofits require fitting modern infrastructure into constrained, often irregular spaces.

### Clash Detection Strategies

Effective coordination starts with a robust BIM execution plan. We utilize Navisworks not just for identifying clashes, but for managing the resolution workflow.

1.  **Soft Clashes**: Ensuring maintenance access zones are respected.
2.  **Hard Clashes**: Physical intersections between ductwork and structural beams.
3.  **Workflow Clashes**: Scheduling conflicts between trades.

## Case Study: The downtown Lofts

In our recent project in Chicago, we utilized a "federated model" approach. Each trade updated their central model weekly, allowing for real-time conflict resolution before fabrication began.

```json
{
  "project": "Downtown Lofts",
  "clashes_detected": 1450,
  "clashes_resolved_pre_construction": 1420,
  "savings_estimated": "$250,000"
}
```

## Conclusion

By front-loading the coordination effort, we significantly reduced change orders during construction, proving that digital rehearsal is essential for complex retrofits.
